## About the Project
LogiMax was developed as part of a **group project** to efficiently manage warehouse operations.  
It allows leadership to monitor stock levels, track order processing, and get a real-time overview of warehouse activity.  

The application pulls all warehouse data from an **external API**, stores it in a **MongoDB instance**, and visualizes key metrics using **VegaLite graphs**, providing interactive insights for decision-makers.  

As part of the collaborative effort, my main responsibilities included:

- Backend API development with Node.js and Express
- Database schema design and MongoDB integration
- Authentication and role-based access control
- Data visualization setup using VegaLite
- TypeScript integration for strict type safety
